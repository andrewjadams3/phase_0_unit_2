# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
#
# I discovered the #select method! This method will return an array or hash
# (depending on what it is called on) containing only the elements for which the
# block it is passed returns true. I chose to use the destructive version of
# this method, which modifies the array or hash in place.
#
# Another very similar method I discovered was #keep_if. The subtle difference
# between #select and #keep_if is this: if no changes were made (a true
# condition was never encountered), #select will return nil, while #keep_if will
# return the original object.

# Reflect!
# I'm glad I spent the time to read through both the Array and Hash Ruby docs to
# discover the #select and #keep_if methods. I learned quite a bit about how 
# these objects function, and discovered a number of new methods. It was a bit
# time consuming, but I feel like I have a deeper understanding. Methods like
# these will save me quite a bit of time in the future. I'm looking forward to 
# reading about the methods others in my accountability group discover!
